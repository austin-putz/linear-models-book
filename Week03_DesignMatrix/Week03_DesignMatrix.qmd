# Week 3: Building the Design Matrix Framework {#sec-week03}

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Construct design matrices from raw data
2. Understand different coding schemes (cell means, reference cell)
3. Write the general linear model in matrix form
4. State and interpret model assumptions

## Coming Soon

This chapter is under development. The complete content will include:

- From raw data to matrix representation
- The general linear model: **y = Xβ + e**
- Building X for continuous and categorical predictors
- Coding schemes (cell means, effects, reference cell)
- Model assumptions (Gauss-Markov conditions)
- Small numerical example: Litter size across breeds
- Realistic application: Broiler body weight by sex
- R implementation and exercises
