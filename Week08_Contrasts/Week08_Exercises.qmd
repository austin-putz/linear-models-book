## Conceptual Questions

### Question 1: Estimability Proof

Prove that in a one-way ANOVA effects model with the sum-to-zero constraint ($\sum_{i=1}^{g} \alpha_i = 0$), the contrast $\alpha_i - \alpha_j$ is estimable even though the individual $\alpha_i$ parameters are not uniquely estimable.

*Hint*: Show that the contrast vector is in the row space of the design matrix $\mathbf{X}$.

### Question 2: Orthogonal Contrasts

Explain why a set of $g-1$ orthogonal contrasts completely partitions the treatment sum of squares in a balanced one-way ANOVA. What property of orthogonal vectors makes this possible? What happens if the design is unbalanced?

### Question 3: Genetic Evaluation Context

In a genetic evaluation context, explain the difference between:
- Testing "Sire A is different from Sire B" (a contrast)
- Estimating "Sire A has a breeding value of +10 kg" (potentially non-estimable)

Why is the first statement testable while the second may not be uniquely estimable?

## Computational Problems

### Problem 1: Swine Litter Size

Three sow breeds are compared for litter size. Data (pigs per litter):

- Yorkshire: 11, 12, 11
- Landrace: 10, 11, 10
- Duroc: 9, 10, 9

a. Fit the cell means model and obtain breed mean estimates
b. Test $H_0$: Yorkshire = Landrace using a contrast $\mathbf{c} = [1, -1, 0]'$
c. Test $H_0$: Yorkshire = $\frac{1}{2}$(Landrace + Duroc)
d. Construct 95% confidence intervals for each contrast
e. Verify that the contrasts in (b) and (c) are orthogonal

### Problem 2: Non-Orthogonal Contrasts

Using dairy herd data with unbalanced sample sizes:
- Herd 1: n = 8, mean = 32.5 kg/day
- Herd 2: n = 10, mean = 34.2 kg/day
- Herd 3: n = 6, mean = 30.8 kg/day
- Herd 4: n = 12, mean = 33.1 kg/day
- MSE = 4.5, df = 32

a. Define two contrasts that are NOT orthogonal
b. Show computationally that their sums of squares do NOT sum to SS(Herds)
c. Compute the correlation between the two contrast estimates

### Problem 3: Verify Estimability

Create a design matrix $\mathbf{X}$ for a one-way ANOVA effects model (not full rank).

a. Define $\mathbf{c}_1$ = vector for an individual parameter (e.g., $\mu$ or $\alpha_1$)
b. Define $\mathbf{c}_2$ = vector for an estimable contrast (e.g., $\alpha_1 - \alpha_2$)
c. Use the `is_estimable()` function to test both
d. Use different generalized inverses and show that $\mathbf{c}_1'\mathbf{b}$ changes but $\mathbf{c}_2'\mathbf{b}$ remains constant

## Applied Problems

### Problem 1: Broiler Strain Comparison

A dataset is provided comparing body weight at 42 days across 6 broiler strains (data available on course website).

a. Design 4 biologically meaningful contrasts. At least one should compare fast-growing commercial strains vs. heritage breeds.
b. Test each contrast and report results (estimate, SE, t-statistic, p-value)
c. Interpret results biologically
d. Report which contrasts are significant at $\alpha = 0.05$

### Problem 2: Sheep Breed Evaluation

Five sheep breeds are compared for weaning weight:
- Dorset, Suffolk, Hampshire, Rambouillet, Merino

Research question: "Are Dorset and Suffolk (meat breeds) similar to each other, and together different from the other breeds (wool/dual-purpose)?"

a. Formulate this as a set of orthogonal contrasts
b. Test the complete set
c. Create a visualization showing breed means and contrast results
d. Write a brief report (1 paragraph) interpreting the results for a sheep producer
