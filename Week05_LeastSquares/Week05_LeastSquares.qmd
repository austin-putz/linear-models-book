# Week 5: Least Squares Theory {#sec-week05}

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Understand why least squares estimates are "best"
2. Prove properties of LS estimators (unbiasedness, minimum variance)
3. Derive distributions of estimates and test statistics
4. Compute and interpret variance estimates

## Coming Soon

This chapter is under development. The complete content will include:

- Least squares criterion and derivation
- Gauss-Markov Theorem (BLUE properties)
- Projection matrices and geometry
- Sum of squares decomposition
- Variance estimation and distribution theory
- Small example: Dairy fat vs protein
- Realistic application: Lamb weaning weights
- R implementation and exercises
