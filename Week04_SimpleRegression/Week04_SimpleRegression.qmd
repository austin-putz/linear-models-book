# Week 4: Simple Linear Regression {#sec-week04}

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Derive least squares estimates for simple linear regression
2. Interpret slope and intercept parameters
3. Make predictions and compute residuals
4. Understand the geometry of least squares

## Coming Soon

This chapter is under development. The complete content will include:

- Model: yᵢ = β₀ + β₁xᵢ + eᵢ
- Normal equations and solutions
- Fitted values and residuals
- Small example: Broiler weight vs age
- Realistic application: Dairy lactation curves
- R implementation and exercises
