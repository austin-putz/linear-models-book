# Week 6: Multiple Regression {#sec-week06}

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

1. Extend simple regression to multiple predictors
2. Interpret partial regression coefficients
3. Understand collinearity and its consequences
4. Compare sequential vs. partial sums of squares

## Coming Soon

This chapter is under development. The complete content will include:

- Multiple regression model
- Interpretation of partial coefficients
- R² and adjusted R²
- Sequential vs. partial SS
- F-tests and t-tests
- Collinearity and VIF
- Small example: Lamb weaning weight prediction
- Realistic application: Beef carcass marbling
- R implementation and exercises
